# Rebuilding the Fallen Tent

## Session 13: These Are The Daves I Know

---
layout: statement

# Galatians 3: Christ, the son of David, is the promised seed of Abraham.
# Romans 15: The subjugation of the nations to Israel's king is accomplished through the proclamation of the gospel.

<!--
* David's prophetic voice is used to help Paul talk about what God has done in Christ, but also to revoice the Psalms in the mouth of Jesus.
* God's promises to David are connected to the promises to Abraham.
* Jesus as David's descendant is the one who obtains the obedience of the Gentiles. Unlike David, however, this happens through the proclamation of the gospel, not through political subjugation.
  * Nevertheless, for Paul, this does not make Jesus any less the "root of Jesse"; Jesus's status as Israel's king *and* the hope of the Gentiles are not at odds with one another. Jesus doesn't need to abandon his messiahship so that the Gentiles may worship Israel's god.

work: Samuel Anoints David
metadata: "Fresco from the Dura-Europos synagogue, Syria, ca. 3rd c. AD"

<!--
* The Dura-Europos synagogue consistutes of of the oldest known examples of Jewish art.
  * One striking thing about this depiction of David is that he is portrayed as an essentially Greek or Roman figure.
  * This David takes the form of a beardless Hellenistic youth and is anointed by a toga-wearing Samuel.
* The depiction in the synagogue is joined by a nearby third century Christian church, which also features depictions of David, notably his battle with Goliath.
  * For more on this, see [Michael Peppard](https://www.ancientjewreview.com/read/2016/4/18/david-as-warrior-at-dura-europos).

<!--
* This portrayal utilizes the atheletic ideal of the Renaissance-era revival of the *classical* ideal.
* David is dragged through time into a 16th century appropriation of a 5th century BC Greek ideal.
* This particular work has become, in turn, an exemplar of that Renaissance appropriation.

# 2 Sam 7:5–16
“Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord: … When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom….
And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me.
Your throne shall be established forever.’”

# 2 Sam 12:7--10
“Thus says the <sc>Lord</sc>, the God of Israel: I anointed you king over Israel, and I rescued you from the hand of Saul; I gave you your master’s house, and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah\.\.\.\.
Why have you despised the word of the <sc>Lord</sc>, to do what is evil in his sight? \.\.\.
Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, for you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.”

# Psalm 89:29–35
“I will establish [David’s] offspring forever and his throne as the days of the heavens.
If his children forsake my law… then I will punish their transgression..., but I will not remove from him my steadfast love....
I will not lie to David.”

# Jer 33:14–16
“In those days and at that time I will make a righteous Branch sprout from David’s line; he will do what is just and right in the land.’”

# Ezekiel 34:23–24
“I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David\.\.\.\. he shall feed them and be their shepherd.”

# Amos 9:11
On that day I will raise up the booth of David that is fallen... and rebuild it as in the days of old.

<!--
* The supreme irony of David's consistent association with Israel's restoration is that David's own violence doomed his house to destruction.
* David's line is perpetually afflicted by violence and conflict, but nevertheless it is David and his line who will apparently bind up the flock of Israel and participate in the nation's restoration after exile.
* Notably, Amos 9:11 acknowledges the decrepit state of the Davidic house; just as God said to David "I will build you a house," he here promises to rebuild that house, here described as a "tent."
  * This evokes David's protestation that God should not dwell in a tent, but ought to have a *house*.

# 2 Sam 23:1--5
Now these are the last words of David:\
The oracle of David, son of Jesse,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the oracle of the man whom God exalted,\
the anointed of the God of Jacob,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the favorite of the Strong One of Israel:\
The spirit of the <sc>Lord</sc> speaks through me,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his word is upon my tongue\.\.\.\.\
For he has made with me an everlasting covenant,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ordered in all things and secure.\
Will he not cause to prosper\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all my help and my desire?

# 1 Chron 28:11--19
Then David gave his son Solomon the plan of the vestibule of the temple, and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, and its inner chambers, and of the room for the mercy seat;
and the plan of all that he had \[by the Spirit\]\.\.\.\.
\[David then said to Solomon,\] “All this, in writing at the <sc>Lord</sc>’s direction, he made clear to me—the plan of all the works.”

<!--
* Many English translations have "all that he had in mind" in v. 12, but I opt for the more prophetically-tinged "by the Spirit" here (MT: ותבנית כל אשר היה ברוח עמו; LXX: ὃ εἶχεν
ἐν πνεύματι αὐτοῦ).
  * On this point, see Jürg Hutzli,“David in the Role of a Second Moses – The Revelation of the Temple-Model (Tabnît) in 1 Chronicles 28”, in *Chronicles and the Priestly Literature of the Hebrew Bible*, ed. Jaeyoung Jeon and Louis C. Jonker, *BZAW* 528 (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2021), 325–26.

# 11Q5 27.1--11: “David's Compositions”
And David, son of Jesse, was wise, and a light like the light of the sun, and learned,\
and discerning, and perfect in all his paths before God and men. And\
YHWH gave him a discerning and enlightened spirit. And he wrote psalms:\
three thousand six hundred; and songs to be sung before the altar over the perpetual\
offering of every day, for all the days of the year: three hundred\
and sixty-four; and for the sabbath offerings: fifty-two songs\.\.\.\.\
All these he spoke through the spirit of prophecy which had been given to him from before the Most High.

# Josephus, *Antiquities* 6.165--166
Then, taking the oil, with David looking on, \[Samouel\] smeared it on him and spoke softly in his ear, indicating that God had chosen him to rule as king\.\.\.\.
The Deity then abandoned Saoul and went over to David.
Once the divine spirit transferred to him, he began to prophesy.
A certain suffering beset Saoul and demons caused him to suffocate and choke\.\.\.\.

<!--
* 11Q5 not only portrays David as a divinely inspired prophet, but also amplifies his lyrical output far beyond the canonical psalms.
  * David becomes the superintendent of the liturgical calendar, providing songs for every day of the year.
* In Josephus's retelling of the story of David's anointing, David and Saul swap places, with David becoming the recipient of the divine spirit that is associated with kingship.
  * As a result, David prophesies while Saul is tormented by demons.

# Acts 2:29--32
“Fellow Israelites, I may say to you confidently of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne.
Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘He was not abandoned to Hades,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor did his flesh experience corruption.’\
This Jesus God raised up, and of that all of us are witnesses.

# Acts 4:24--25
When they heard it, they raised their voices together to God and said, “Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and everything in them, it is you who said by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David, your servant:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Why did the Gentiles rage,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the peoples imagine vain things?...’”
