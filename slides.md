# Christ-language in Paul:
# A few statements

<!--
* The material in this lecture is heavily based on Matthew V. Novenson, *Christ among the Messiahs: Christ Language in Paul and Messiah Language in Ancient Judaism* (New York, N.Y.: Oxford University Press, 2012).

# 1. Paul uses the word χριστός 270 times

<!--
* Novenson: "Strictly by volume, then, Paul could be called the most messianically interested of any ancient Jewish or Christian author. But of course, things are not so simple. It is not frequency alone but the particular uses of words that matter most for questions of interpretation."

# 2. Paul does not explicitly define how he understands the term χριστός

<!--
* We don't have phrases like "Jesus is the Christ" or the more specific engagement with messianic traditions that we get in the Gospels.
* This makes Paul rather idiosyncratic within the broader content of early Judaism.
  * On the one hand, Paul uses Christ language with an unusual frequency, far more so than any other early Jewish author.
  * On the other hand, Paul's use of Christ language leaves a large interpretive gap that must be crossed. His usage and understanding of what it means that Jesus is the Christ is not always clear.
* Some interpreters have understood "Christ" to simply be a name or a way to refer to Jesus.
  * On this view, Paul's frequent use of the word χριστός is explained by the status of the term as a name or some other sort of non-messianic title.
  * In some iterations of this view, Paul's understanding of Jesus is stripped of any messianic significance, i.e., Jesus is in fact not the messiah of early Judaism, he is not the rescuer of Israel or the Jewish people. Rather, "Christ" becomes something else, a non-messianic savior for Gentiles, e.g., F. C. Baur; Novenson, 13--19.
    * N.B.: Some forms of this view are driven in no small part by anti-semitic bias and a need to minimize or explain away connections between Christianity and Judaism.
  * Alternatively, as Gentiles begin espousing Christ-belief, they also adopt Christ language but without the Jewish associations (Novenson, 22).
* More recently, some interpreters have attempted a more maximalist approach, where Christ language is all messiah, all the time. This may or may not be the case, depending on the specifics of how language is being used is various contexts.

# 3. Biblical and non-biblical messiah texts leave a lot of room for Paul to operate

<!--
* On the one hand, the term "Christ" is almost never used in the Jewish scriptures and no singular definition of "the messiah" is presented.
* On the other hand, early Jewish authors consistently use the same texts to constitute their messianic vocabulary: "Not only did the authors of ancient messiah texts find their messiahs in the Jewish scriptures; they found them in the same particular scriptures.... Perhaps the most striking feature of this list of scriptures frequently cited in later messiah texts is that none of them actually contains the word 'messiah'" (Novenson, 57--58).
  * These texts are then interpreted in various ways.
  * The point here is that the presence or absence of Christ language is not reliably determinative of meaning.
  * We need to look at how a particular author, in this case Paul, particularly uses Christ language in conversation with the Jewish scriptures.

# 4. Paul does not engage early Jewish messianism in the same way as, e.g., the Gospels

# Galatians 3:6--18

Just as Abraham “believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,” so, you see, those who believe are the descendants of Abraham.
And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, declared the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “All the Gentiles shall be blessed in you.”
For this reason, those who believe are blessed with Abraham who believed\.\.\.\.
Brothers and sisters, I give an example from daily life: once a person’s will has been ratified, no one adds to it or annuls it.
Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his \[seed\]; it does not say, “And to \[seeds\],” as of many; but it says, “And to your \[seed\],” that is, <span v-mark="{ color: '#b5595f', type: 'highlight', click: 1 }">to one person, who is Christ.</span>
My point is this: the law, which came four hundred thirty years later, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.
For if the inheritance comes from the law, it no longer comes from the promise; but God granted it to Abraham through the promise.

# According to Paul, the promise pertains to *Abraham's singular offspring*, not *offsprings*.

<!--
* Some translations unhelpfully use "offspring," which obscures the singular/plural difference in English: οὐ λέγει· καὶ τοῖς σπέρμασιν, ὡς ἐπὶ πολλῶν ἀλλʼ ὡς ἐφʼ ἑνός καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου, ὅς ἐστιν Χριστός (Gal 3:16).

# Genesis 17:7
I will establish my covenant between me and you, and your \[seed\] after you (τοῦ σπέρματός σου μετὰ σὲ) throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your \[seed\] after you (τοῦ σπέρματός σου μετὰ σέ).

# 2 Samuel 7:l2
When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you (ἀναστήσω τὸ σπέρμα σου μετὰ σέ), who shall come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me.

<!--
* Paul's reading of the promises to Abraham as being fulfilled not in *Jesus* but in *Christ* is significant.
* The idea isn't so much that Jesus is in some way the fulfillment of the promises to Abraham, but that God has fulfilled those promises *in messiah*. That messiah happens to be Jesus. The fulfillment of the promise to David is the fulfillment of the promise to Abraham.
* The fulfillment of the by-faith covenant is also the fulfillment of the specific promises made by God concerning Israel's monarchy. These two things are not separable.

# Romans 15:3--4

We who are strong ought to put up with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
Each of us must please our neighbor for the good purpose of building up the neighbor.
For Christ did not please himself; but, as it is written, “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.”
For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, so that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.

# Psalm 69:9
It is zeal for your house that has consumed me;\
&emsp;the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.

# Romans 11:9
And David says,\
&emsp;“Let their table become a snare and a trap,\
&emsp;&emsp;a stumbling block and a retribution for them\.\.\.\.”


<!--
* This is clearly a scriptural citation, but Paul does not mention David himself, even though this is a David-psalm.
  * It is not the case that Paul is unaware of the David connection or doesn't care about it; he quotes the same psalm earlier in Romans and attributes the words to David himself (Rom 11:9).
  * Paul seems to be consciously removing these words from the mouth of David and placing them in the mouth of Jesus such that the words of Prophet David become the words of Christ the servant.
* David's prophetic voice is not the only voice that is available when reading the Psalms in a prophetic way. Jesus's voice can also serve to sing the psalm in reference to different circumstances. This prophetic revoicing is the basis for encouragement for the church from the scriptures.

# Romans 15:7--12

Welcome one another... just as Christ has welcomed you\.\.\.\.
For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised... in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy.
As it is written,\
&emsp;“Therefore I will confess you among the Gentiles,\
&emsp;&emsp;and sing praises to your name” (Ps 18:49);\
and again he says,\
&emsp;“Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people” (Deut 32:43);\
and again,\
&emsp;“Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,\
&emsp;&emsp;and let all the peoples praise him” (Ps 117:1);\
and again Isaiah says,\
&emsp;“The root of Jesse shall come,\
&emsp;&emsp;the one who rises to rule the Gentiles;\
&emsp;in him the Gentiles shall hope” (Isa 11:10).

<!--
* Once again we see that Paul seems to place the words of Prophet David in the mouth of Jesus, although less explicitly as before. Nevertheless, the words of the Psalms are being used as the content of Christ's declaration to the Gentiles.
* Perhaps more interesting, however, is what Paul does with Isa 11.
  * Isaiah 11 describes God's reclaiming of his scattered people from the nations, reversing the sentence of exile imposed on Israel as a result of the covenant curses of Deut 28.
  * However, the gathering of the nations to the "root of Jesse" also involves Israel's plundering of those nations. The assembly of Israel subjugates Philistia, Edom, Moab, Egypt, and Assyria.
  * Thus, the Gentiles praise God and gather to Israel's king as vassals.

# Psalm 18:46--50
You delivered me from strife with the peoples;\
&emsp;you made me head of the nations;\
&emsp;people whom I had not known <span v-mark="{ color: '#b5595f', type: 'highlight', click: 1 }">\[obeyed\] me</span>\.\.\.\.\
For this I will extol you, O <sc>Lord</sc>, among the nations,\
&emsp;and sing praises to your name.\
Great triumphs he gives to his king,\
&emsp;and shows steadfast love to his anointed,\
&emsp;to David and his descendants forever.

# Isaiah 11:14
They shall put forth their hand against Edom and Moab,\
&emsp;and the Ammonites shall <span v-mark="{ color: '#b5595f', type: 'highlight', click: 1 }">obey them.</span>

# Romans 15:15--19
Nevertheless on some points I have written to you rather boldly by way of reminder, because of the grace given me by God to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to boast of my work for God.
For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to win <span v-mark="{ color: '#b5595f', type: 'highlight', click: 1 }">obedience from the Gentiles</span>, by word and deed, by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and as far around as Illyricum I have fully proclaimed the good news of Christ.

# Christ, the son of David, is the promised seed of Abraham.
# The subjugation of the nations to Israel's king is accomplished through the proclamation of the gospel.

<!--
* David's prophetic voice is used to help Paul talk about what God has done in Christ, but also to revoice the Psalms in the mouth of Jesus.
* God's promises to David are connected to the promises to Abraham.
* Jesus as David's descendant is the one who obtains the obedience of the Gentiles. Unlike David, however, this happens through the proclamation of the gospel, not through political subjugation.
  * Nevertheless, for Paul, this does not make Jesus any less the "root of Jesse"; Jesus's status as Israel's king *and* the hope of the Gentiles are not at odds with one another. Jesus doesn't need to abandon his messiahship so that the Gentiles may worship Israel's god.
